        description: "Why does nobody understand how the economy works. The small little town im from in oklahoma is an oil town. The town over is an oil town. All of the towns in the surrounding area are oil towns. All towns in the state are oil towns. All towns in the entire country are oil towns. What that means is if you dont work for walmart or mcdonalds then you are most likely working for the oilfield or for a company who is a direct by product of the oil field. So guess what is the fastest way to destroy this country's economy? Thats it you guessed it. Destroy the oil field. So why do you think its been the democrats sole purpose to destroy the oilfield? Because they want to destroy the american economy. Thats been there life's mission. So while the republicans are doing everything in their power to restore our economy they are constantly being undermined by idiot democrats and idiots like you",
