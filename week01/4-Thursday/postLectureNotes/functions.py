# Dear ABC College Admission’s Board:

# My name is Karen Jones. I have served as a science teacher at Parktown High School for the past fifteen years and have had the privilege to serve as {f_name} {l_name}’s teacher for the past three. I have also been {f_name}’s advisor on the science academic team here at school. Due to his qualifications, I feel that {f_name} would be an excellent addition to your school.

# While he has been a student here, {f_name} has always challenged himself academically, taking all of the AP courses that our school has to offer. He has been captain of the academic team for the past two years, showing strong leadership qualities and organizational skills. His superior written and verbal skills have far surpassed any student of his age.

# {f_name} would bring much to your school, both in and out of the classroom. If you have any questions regarding {f_name}’s qualifications, please contact me at (123) 555-5555 or at Karen.Jones@email.com.

# Sincerely,


# Karen Jones
