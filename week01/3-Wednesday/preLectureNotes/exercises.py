# 1. Create a new list called "planets" that holds all of the names of the planets
# in our solar system. Print the list of planets on the command line.

planet1 = "Earth"
planet2 = "Jupiter"
planet3 = "Neptune"
planet4 = "Mars"
planet5 = "Saturn"
planet6 = "Mercury"
planet7 = "Uranus"
planet8 = "Venus"

# 2. Print out how many elements are in the planet list


# 3. Create a while loop that iterates through each of the items in the planet list
# and changes them to lowercase .


# 4. Add Pluto to the planet list.


# 5. Combine the follwing 2 lists into a list called Houston.
# Find how many cities are listed in the Houston list
# Add more cities to the Houston list.
# Print the list cities (one city per line)

HoustonCities = ["Katy", "Memorial City", "Sugar Land",
                 "The Heights", "River Oaks", "Pasadena"]
ClearLakeCities = ["League City", "Kemah", "Seabrook", "Webster", "El Lago"]

# 6. Since Pluto isn't really a planet, delete it from the planet list


# 7. Create the following lists that are a subset of the Houston list:
# htx1 = The first 4 cities
# htx2 = Cities 3-6
# htx3 = The last 2 cities

# 7. Insert Denver in the Houston list after The Heights

# 8.  Remove the last city from the Houston List

# 9. Get the index of Seabrook from the Houston list

# 10. Sort the list of cities

# 11. Copy the Houston list to a list called USCities

# 12. Remove all items from the Houston list

# 13. Take the following list and multiply 5 times

nums = [4, 5, 7, 8]

# 14


# 15. Reverse the String "DigitalCrafts"


# 16.  Crete a range [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# 17. Create a range [6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16]

# 18.  Loop through the planet list using a for loop and print the name of each planet


# 19.  Loop through the USCities list and print the name of each city

# 20.  Loop through the following sequence [6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16] and multiply each number by 5.  Print the result.

# 21. Create a multiplication table for 1-10

# i.e.  1x1 = 1
#        1x2 = 2
#        1x3 = 3
